# TO DO:
- VCCS: done
- tests need to be written for individual modules to try and break the code
- Independent voltage source: "post-processing" but not sure how exactly
- Adjust indexing scheme to minimize off-diagonal elements: nodes that touch each other should be indexed with sequential node numbers
-> depth first search to determine ideal node indices?
- sensitivity analysis
