# TO DO:
- Transient analysis
    - Implement Trapezoidal approximation (keep Backwards Euler approximation as an option for large-time-constant nodes?)
    - Time-varying sources should be read from the SPICE netlist from the format with ".tran" 
    - Add inductors (with Trapezoidal & BE approximation)
